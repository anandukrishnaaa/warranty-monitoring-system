# Warranty Monitoring System

Product warranties have been around for generations, but formal approaches for 
establishing and examining warranties have been considered only during the past 20 years.
Warranties ensure that the manufacturer or seller undertakes the responsibilities of a
product, when you carry out a major purchase. Warranty details and instructions must be 
available for the customer to read through a catalogue before they finalize the purchase. 
You can compare the extent of warranty coverage just as you compare the style, price, and
other characteristics of a product. However, the main problem usually faced by a customer
is with the reporting of issues to the product manufacturer. It will take a huge amount of 
time to directly communicate with the manufacturer and subsequently with the service 
center. It becomes difficult to check and claim warranty. To overcome these warranty
related issues and keeping these facts in mind, we are in an attempt to create the Warranty 
Monitoring System (WMS).
The system administrator can manage the information regarding the companies, shops and 
products that are registered to the system. Manufacturing companies can enlist their
profiles, add products and their corresponding warranty information. When any complaint 
regarding a product becomes apparent, the system enables the customer to report the issue
and check warranty. The manufacturing company has monopoly to evaluate the problem 
and eventually solve the issue, if the product is within the given warranty period.
The main aim of this project is to facilitate warranty claim at e-commerce level more 
accessible and easier, for both the manufacturer and the end-user. The system enables 
users to easily check their products against its warranty period, claim warranty and even 
extend warranties. This system, if enforced and utilized to it’s full potential can truly be a 
harbinger of positive change, at all levels.

Warranty monitoring system is used by manufacturers to handle and manage processes 
associated with product warranties and claim processing. This system can handle
operations from both the ends of a business- the manufacturer side and the consumer side. 
The manufacturer can use the system to register shops and service centers that are 
authorized to trade and handle their products. This allows for a more controlled ecosystem 
that helps in quality assurance and customer satisfaction. The consumers can make use of 
the system to look up their product warranties and even extend their warranty coverage. In 
addition, this system also allows exclusive access for the enlisted consumers to directly 
purchase products through the website that makes the whole process effortless and easy. 
Offline purchases can also be updated by the authorized sellers to the system so that the 
consumer can keep track of all the purchases made both offline and online. The main 
objective of this project is to put forward a platform that can help manufacturers and end 
consumers to seamlessly shop, keep track of what they have shopped, claim warranties for 
what they have shopped and for the manufacturers, this helps to optimize business 
operations, improve efficiency in manufacturing and productions.
