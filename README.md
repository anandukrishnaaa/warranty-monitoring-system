# Warranty Monitoring System

Warranty Monitoring System (WMS) aims to create an easy and accessible platform for manufacturers and end consumers to handle and manage product warranties and claim processing. The system allows manufacturers to register shops and service centers that are authorized to trade and handle their products, leading to a more controlled ecosystem that helps in quality assurance and customer satisfaction. On the consumer side, the system allows users to easily check their products against its warranty period, claim warranty, and even extend warranties. The system also allows exclusive access for the enlisted consumers to directly purchase products through the website, making the process effortless and easy. Offline purchases can also be updated by the authorized sellers to the system so that the consumer can keep track of all purchases made both offline and online. The main objective of this project is to put forward a platform that can help manufacturers optimize business operations and improve efficiency in manufacturing and productions and for consumers, it helps them to seamlessly shop, keep track of what they have shopped and claim warranties for what they have shopped.
